  Let's use Grainger Library as an example.
  Say "Grainger Library information" to get basic information about the library, such as consulting hours, phone number, email and address.
  Say "Grainger Library opening hours tomorrow" to get tomorrow's opening hours of Grainger library, or for any other specific date.
  Say "Grainger Library next seven days" to get the opening hours of Grainger library for the next seven days, including today.
  There are many more questions that I can answer. 
  For example, say "sample questions" if you want to hear other valid expressions.
  Or say "catalog" to see which libraries are supported.
  You can try it out now.
